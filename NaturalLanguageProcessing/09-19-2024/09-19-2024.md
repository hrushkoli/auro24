# 09-19-2024 NLP - Feature Extraction

## The Bag of Word Technique

- It is a simple and flexible way of extracting features from documents.
- It can find the occurence of certain words this is called as the feature count.
- Since ML models cannot understand sentances, they will need to have vector inputs, this is created by using feature counts.
- When the vector matrix is created, it creates rows for each sentence.
- **Drawback:** It just keeps a track of word counts and disregards the grammatical details about the word order as it treats each word equally.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer

corpus = ['Data science is an overlap between Arts and Science', 'generally, arts graduates are right brained and science graduates are left brained' 'Excelling in both arts and sciences at  a time becomes difficult', 'Natural Language Processing is a part of Data Science']
bow_model = CountVectorizer()
print(bow_model.fit_transform(corpus).todense())


bow_df = pd.DataFrame(bow_model.fit_transform(corpus).todense())
bow_df.columns = sorted(bow_model.vocabulary_)
bow_df.head()

# Getting Top Most Frequency words
bow_model = CountVectorizer(max_features=10)
bow_df = pd.DataFrame(bow_model.fit_transform(corpus).todense())
bow_df.columns = sorted(bow_model.vocabulary_)
bow_df.to_html()
```
**Output:**
<table border="1" class="dataframe">
<thead>\n    <tr style="text-align: right;">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>and</th>\n      <th>are</th>\n      <th>arts</th>\n      <th>data</th>\n      <th>graduates</th>\n      <th>is</th>\n      <th>part</th>\n      <th>processing</th>\n      <th>right</th>\n      <th>science</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>0</th>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>2</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>1</th>\n      <td>2</td>\n      <td>2</td>\n      <td>2</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>2</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2</th>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>
