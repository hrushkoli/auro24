## Computational linguistics

Computational linguistics (CL) is what powers anything in a machine or device that has to do with language - Speaking, Writing, Reading, and Listening.

It is oftern linked with Natural Language Processing (NLP), which is a subset of CL.

## NLP - NLU - NLG

### NLP
CCL-> NLP:

NLP : Evolved from CL uses methods from various disciplines, such as <computer science, AI, linguistics, and data science> to <enable computers to understand human language in both written and verbal.>

While CL has more of a focus on <aspects of Language> 

NLP emphasizes its use of <ML> and <DL> to complte tasks, like language translation or question answering.

## NLP

It uses syntactic and semantic analysis of text and speech to determine the meaning of sentance.

- syntax refers to the grammatical structure of a sentence
- semantics suggest to its intended meaning

NLU also establishes a relevant ontology: a data structure which specifies the relationship between words and phrases.

ex. Used in data mining to understand consumer attitudes.


### Levels of NLP

1. Phonological
At this level it deals with pronunciation

2. Morphology 
Deals with the smallest words that convey meaning and suffixes and prefixes.
