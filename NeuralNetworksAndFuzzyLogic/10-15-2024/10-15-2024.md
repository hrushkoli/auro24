## CNN 

Convolutional Neural Network is used to work with images by reduce the image size in order t o reduce processing without losing information.

It Consists of two important factors:

1. Convolution Layer 
2. Pooling Layer


A ***filter*** is a set of learnable weights which are learned using the backpropogation algorithm. It can be thought of as storing a single template/pattern. 

We use ***padding*** to add an extra set of pixels surrounding the original pixel grid.
