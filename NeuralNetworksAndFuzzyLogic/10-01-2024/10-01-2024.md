- Standardization is used for fields which have continuous data and if we want to scale that particular field with normally distributed values where mean is always 0 and Standard Deviation is 1 , we will use Standardization.
- Normalization - When we will scale out the fields between 0 & 1, we will use normalization

```python 
import tensorflow as tf 
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models 
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split 

import pandas as pd 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 

import seaborn as snb 

df = pd.read_csv('./house_prediction.csv')
df.head()
df.info()
df.describe()

df.drop(['country'],axis=1)
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 5))
snb.heatmap(df.corr(),annot=True,cmap='vrdis')
plt.plot()
X = df.lloc[:1]
Y = df.price
```
