## Introduction of Modules

Refers to a set of classes or functions that can be imported in our code.

- **Implicit:**

## How to create a module

Modules can be simply created by 

***claci.py***
```python
def addition(a,b):
    return(a+b)
def subtract(a,b):
    return(a+b)
```
***test.py***
```python
import moduleExample.calci as calci
print(calci.addition(10,5))
print(calci.subtract(10,5))
```
